//! Node Replication (NR) is a library which can be used to implement a concurrent version
//! of any single-threaded data structure. It takes in a single threaded implementation of
//! said data structure, and scales it out to multiple cores and NUMA nodes by combining
//! three techniques: reader-writer locks, operation logging and flat combining.
//!
//! # How does it work
//! To replicate a single-threaded data structure, one needs to implement the [`Dispatch`]
//! trait for it. The following snippet implements [`Dispatch`] for
//! `std::collections::HashMap` as an example. The full example (using [`NodeReplicated`]
//! and [`Dispatch`] can be found in the
//! [examples](https://github.com/vmware/node-replication/tree/master/nr/examples/hashmap.rs)
//! folder.
//!
//! ```
//! use node_replication::Dispatch;
//! use std::collections::HashMap;
//!
//! /// The node-replicated hashmap uses a std hashmap internally.
//! pub struct NrHashMap {
//!    storage: HashMap<u64, u64>,
//! }
//!
//! /// We support a mutable put operation on the hashmap.
//! #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Clone)]
//! pub enum Modify {
//!    Put(u64, u64),
//! }
//!
//! /// We support an immutable read operation to lookup a key from the hashmap.
//! #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Clone)]
//! pub enum Access {
//!    Get(u64),
//! }
//!
//! /// The Dispatch traits executes `ReadOperation` (our Access enum)
//! /// and `WriteOperation` (our Modify enum) against the replicated
//! /// data-structure.
//! impl Dispatch for NrHashMap {
//!    type ReadOperation = Access;
//!    type WriteOperation = Modify;
//!    type Response = Option<u64>;
//!
//!    /// The `dispatch` function applies the immutable operations.
//!    fn dispatch(&self, op: Self::ReadOperation) -> Self::Response {
//!        match op {
//!            Access::Get(key) => self.storage.get(&key).map(|v| *v),
//!        }
//!    }
//!
//!    /// The `dispatch_mut` function applies the mutable operations.
//!    fn dispatch_mut(
//!        &mut self,
//!        op: Self::WriteOperation,
//!    ) -> Self::Response {
//!        match op {
//!            Modify::Put(key, value) => self.storage.insert(key, value),
//!        }
//!    }
