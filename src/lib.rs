//! Node Replication(NR) is a library which can be used to implement a concurrent version of any
//! single threaded data structure: It takes in a single threaded implementation of said data
//! structure, and scales it out to multiple cores and NUMA nodes by combining two techniques:
//! operation logging and flat combining.
//!
//! # How does it work
//! To replicate a single-threaded data structure, one needs to implement [Dispatch](trait.Dispatch.html) trait.
//! The following example uses hashmap as an example.
//! ```
//! use node_replication::Dispatch;
//! use std::collections::HashMap;
//!
//! /// The single-threaded NrHashMap which internally uses std HashMap.
//! pub struct NrHashMap {
//!    storage: HashMap<u64, u64>,
//! }
//!
//! /// We support mutable Put() operation on the NrHashMap.
//! #[derive(Debug, Eq, PartialEq, Clone)]
//! pub enum OpWr {
//!    Put(u64, u64),
//! }
//!
//! /// We support immutable Get() operation on the NrHashMap.
//! #[derive(Debug, Eq, PartialEq, Clone)]
//! pub enum OpRd {
//!    Get(u64),
//! }
//!
//! /// The Dispatch traits executes `ReadOperation` (our OpRd enum)
//! /// and `WriteOperation` (our `OpWr` enum) against the replicated
//! /// data-structure.
//! impl Dispatch for NrHashMap {
//!    type ReadOperation = OpRd;
//!    type WriteOperation = OpWr;
//!    type Response = Option<u64>;
//!    type ResponseError = ();
//!
//!    /// The `dispatch` function applies the immutable operations.
//!    fn dispatch(&self, op: Self::ReadOperation) -> Result<Self::Response, Self::ResponseError> {
//!        match op {
//!            OpRd::Get(key) => Ok(self.storage.get(&key).map(|v| *v)),
//!        }
//!    }
//!
//!    /// The `dispatch_mut` function applies the mutable operations.
//!    fn dispatch_mut(
//!        &mut self,
//!        op: Self::WriteOperation,
//!    ) -> Result<Self::Response, Self::ResponseError> {
//!        match op {
//!            OpWr::Put(key, value) => Ok(self.storage.insert(key, value)),
//!        }
//!    }
//! }
//! ```
